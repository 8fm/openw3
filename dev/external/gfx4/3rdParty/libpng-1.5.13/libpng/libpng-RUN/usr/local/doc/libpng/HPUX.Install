-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: You must install zlib first before building or installing libpng.

WARNING: You should either uninstall any previous libpng version prior to
         building/installing this libpng release or you should "gmake install"
         prior to "gmake check" (this avoids using an older version of the
         library, which can cause the test suite to fail).

Files changed:

* Makefile.in:
  - "gmake clean" now also deletes config.cache.

* configure:
  - Cache file is now config.cache, rather than /dev/null.
  - Set up an HP-UX override section, including:
    * Set prefix to /usr/local.
    * Put /usr/local/bin in the front of the PATH.
    * If Itanium, set libdir to /usr/local/lib/hpux32.
    * Compile with "cc -O -I/usr/local/include".
    * Set RANLIB to /bin/true.
    * Enable both shared and static library building.
  - Strip any installed binaries.
  - Set 755 permissions on any installed scripts.
  - Don't link with +h <libname>.
  - Only build <libname>.<libext> as a shared lib (i.e. no version numbers).

To compile:
 
[Install zlib first!]
[Uninstall any previous version of libpng]
[Edit the HP-UX override section of configure for your site,
 particularly the prefix setting]
./configure
gmake
 
To test:
 
gmake check
[This should pass the test OK - if you failed to uninstall any previous release
 of libpng, the test may fail. One workaround is to run "gmake install"
 prior to running "gmake check"]

To install (usually as root):
 
gmake install
